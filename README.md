Abstract
---

We report on the direct detection from observations obtained with the APOGEE survey of a metal- poor ([Fe/H] = −1.3) field giant star in the Milky Way, with an extreme Mg-Al abundance ([Mg/Fe] = -0.31; [Al/Fe]=1.49) seen only among the secondary population of globular clusters. This star, 2M16011638-1201525 found using SDSSIII/APOGEE data also shows particularly atypical light- element patterns not seen among Galactic disk field stars, indicating that it could have been born in a globular cluster. We explore several explanations, in particular studying the orbit of the star to check the probability of it being related to known globular clusters. With the use of a Monte Carlo scheme, we performed simple orbital integrations assuming the estimated distance of 2M16011638-1201525 and the available six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of 63 globular clusters, looking for close encounters in the past with a minimum distance approach within the tidal radius for each cluster. We found a very low probability that 2M16011638-1201525 was ejected from most globular clusters; but, we note that the best progenitor candidate to host this star is globular cluster ω Centauri (also known as NGC 5139). However, our dynamical studies demonstrate that 2M16011638-1201525 reaches a distance |Zmax| < 3 kpc from the Galactic plane and a minimum approach to the Galactic center of Rmin < 0.62 kpc in an eccentric (e ∼ 0.53) and retrograde orbit, raising the possibility that this star has been dynamically ejected into the Milky Way disk from the halo.

Peculiar chemical abundance

Al and Mg abundances of 393 red giant stars in 10 GCs from [Meszaros et al. 2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....149..153M), first generation is marked as open square symbols, and second-generation as filled square symbols. The average metallicity ([Fe/H]) is listed after the cluster name.  The black open hexagon represents to the star analysed in the present work, and the black open symbols the `Schiavon et al. 2016 (submitted)` sample.
