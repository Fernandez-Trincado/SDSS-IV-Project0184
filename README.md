Abstract
---

We report on the direct detection from observations obtained with the APOGEE survey of a metal- poor ([Fe/H]= −1.3) field giant star in the Milky Way, with an extreme Mg-Al abundance ([Mg/Fe]=- 0.31; [Al/Fe]=1.49) seen only among the secondary population of globular clusters. This star, `ID_STAR_HERE` found using SDSSIII/APOGEE data also shows particularly atypical light- element patterns not seen among Galactic disk field stars, indicating that it could have been born in a globular cluster. We explore several explanations, in particular studying the orbit of the star to check the probability of it being related to known globular clusters. With the use of a Monte Carlo scheme, we performed simple orbital integrations assuming the estimated distance of `ID_STAR_HERE` by spectrophotometric parallax methods and the available 6-D data of 63 globular clusters looking for close encounters in the past with a minimum distance approach within the tidal radius for each cluster. We found a very low probability that `ID_STAR_HERE` was ejected from most globu- lar clusters; but, we note that the best progenitor candidate to host this star could be the globular cluster ω Centauri (also known as NGC 5139), because, after all, the propability with ω Centauri is not negligible. However, our dynamical studies demonstrate that `ID_STAR_HERE` reaches a distance |Zmax| < 3 kpc from the Galactic plane and a minimum approach to the Galactic center of Rmin < 0.62 kpc in an eccentric (e ~ 0.53) and retrograde orbit, raising the possibility that this star has been dynamically ejected into the Milky Way disk from the halo.

`ID_STAR_HERE`: More details will be presented in a forthcoming publication (Fernandez-Trincado et al. 2016, submitted).
